								<b><big>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</big></b>
										<br>
                    An Autonomous vehicle is a driverless car. They combine sensors and software to control, navigate and drive the vehicle. It can drive itself to a pre-determined destination in autopilot using many in vehicle technologies. Most of the major automotive manufacturing are exploring this technology such as WAYMO, (google), Aurora, Ford, lphi  And there are many, many more. The main reasons for autonomous vehicles are improving access, increasing efficiency and saving lives. Every 23 seconds around the world someone dies in a car crash.  
                    <br><br>
                    There are many technologies used in developing a driverless vehicles. The most state of art is the use of Artificial Intelligence also known as AI. AI is a constellation of technologies that allows machines to sense, comprehend act and learn with human like levels of intelligence. Technologies like machine learning and natural language processing are all part of the constellation of technologies. We use AI in many other areas not just autonomous vehicles. Most people when they think of AI, they think of what you see in sci-fi films, where machines emulate human intelligence. In our daily life we use soft forms of AI such as Weather apps  Digital Assistants and software that analyses data to optimise a business function or system.

										<br>
										Unfortunately, the use of Autonomous vehicles is still a long way off. Elon musk set the goal of 2019 but suffered setbacks. There has been a number of crashes and some fatal. Uber halted self-driving tests after a fatal accident in Tempe Arizona in 2018. A 49-year-old woman was crossing the road on her bike and was struck by ubers driverless car. The experts do not know why the vehicle did not stop. Unfortunately, the technology is a lot further away than most think. As the technology stands the equivalent in human form would be like putting a 14 year in a car to drive without a driver’s license. In the next 5 years they expect these Autonomous vehicles to be used in fleet vehicles. Most normal people won't own their own as the technology is too expensive, but like most technology, the longer time goes on, the cheaper and more readily available this technology will become.

										<b><big>What technological or other developments make this possible?</big></b>
										<br>
                    Drive-by-wire refers to a number of electronic systems that either augment or replace traditional mechanical controls. Instead of cables or hydraulics to control a vehicle, drive-by-wire technology uses electronic systems to activate brakes, control steering and suspension.

								<b><big>What is the potential impact of this development?</big></b>
										<br>
                    Human driving is often inefficient, and puts a strain on public infrastructure, adding to the congestion of traffic.[61] The Texas transportation institute - estimated that in the year 2000, the 75 largest cities in USA had drivers waste 3.6 billion hours due to inefficient driving, resulting in 21.6 billion litres of fuel wasted, and a loss of 67.5 billion dollars in productivity going to waste. By the introduction of autonomous vehicles, efficiency of travel, whether that be by means of personal or public transport, will be improved. Improving efficiency of travel will give the average person an estimated 50 minutes per day, which is said to be sometime before the half century. This extra 50 minutes per day will help the economy, as those extra 50 minutes may be spent working, or on recreational activities which may cost money. Insurance companies will also have to shift their userbase from consumers to the companies who are manufacturing the cars/software, as they will be the ones liable for accidents now.

										<br><br>
								<b><big>What is likely to change</big></b>
										<br>
                    The changes which are most likely going to happen include an influx of jobless people due to jobs which require vehicles such as transport being made all but redundant as the technology improves, this will also stem to affect jobs where vehicles are used as a secondary means to the primary job, such as police work or travelling salesmen. Cars also need somewhere to be stored, and 95% of the time, your car is parked, autonomous vehicles will not need anywhere near as much parking as we currently have, which will open much more space up for shops/housing/workplaces.[62][62]CaspianReport, 2018. Impact Of Autonomous Vehicles. [video] Available at: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy8gxRD_BUE> [Accessed 11 October 2020].
										<br><br>
								<b><big>Which people will be most affected and how?</big></b>
										<br>
									The obvious victims of autonomous vehicles will be predominantly ones which use vehicles as a means to transport goods or people, such as public transport, delivery drivers, truck drivers, taxi drivers, etc. The people in this line of work will most likely be out of a job completely in years to come as the technology improves.
								<b><big>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</big></b>
										<br>
									As previously stated, any people in a line of work where vehicles are used will be affected, whether that be loss of job, or more efficient means of working. Many jobs will be made redundant as a consequence, but the extra free time and money saved due to efficiency will hopefully counteract the loss of jobs for a percentage of the population.

      <div class="block last"><h1 style=color:black;><big><b>How will this affect you? </big></b></h1>
        <section>
								<b><big>How will this affect you daily?</big></b>
										<br>
									Being Australian, we do not have as much traffic congestion as other places around the world, that being said, in heavily populated areas (such as Sydney or Melbourne), we still currently experience traffic congestions/jams commonly. The introduction of more autonomous driving will improve efficient driving, and reduce travel time.
										<br><br>
								<b><big>What will be different for you?</b></big>
										<br>
									The things that will be of difference to me will be mainly be delivery of items and food, I live in an area where parking and travel is rarely something that takes up too much more time than it should, but also, when autonomous vehicles (AV) are implemented, the fact that I won't have to control the vehicle will mean I will have more time whilst travelling to do whatever I want, whether that is leisure, relaxing or working.
										<br><br>
								<b><big>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</big></b>
										<br>
                    Autonomous vehicles will drastically change times for travelling and delivery, meaning less time waiting for items ordered online, food to be delivered (especially during covid where we want to stay inside as much as possible), and just general downtime of travelling will be decreased, resulting in more time to spend doing things you want to do. For house owners, the freed up space from vacant parking lots will cause housing prices to take a dip, especially in areas where development isn't in high demand, so people who are invested in real-estate, relying off the income of rent will need to be ready.
