								<b><big>Machine Learning
What does it do?
</big></b>
										<br>
										Machine learning is a sub section of Artificial Intelligence that provides systems to automatically learn and improve experience. Machine learning will access data and use it to learn for the development of a computer program.[1]
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>What is the state of the art of this new technology? </b>
										<br>
                                        <br>
										
											• Supervised Learning
                                            <br>
										<br>
By exposing a system to large amounts of labelled data supervised learning can create a dataset for the predictions about the output values. Feeding in images of a blue cars so the algorithm can identify a blue car for example.
<br>
										<br>
	• Un-Supervised Learning
    <br>
										<br>
Using non-labelled data unsupervised learning can discover patterns from datasets. Identifying similarities in data to put into a category which can then be used later on.
<br>
										<br>
	• Semi-Supervised Learning
    <br>
										<br>
A combination of both supervised and unsupervised using both labelled and non-labelled data for training. Usually this method can improve learning accuracy.
<br>
										<br>
	• Reinforcement Learning
    <br>
										<br>
This method will interact with its environment using actions and discovering errors or rewards. This method can produce ideal behaviors through a software agent within a specific context.[3]

										<br>
                                        <br>
											• Image, text and video recognition
 <br>
                                        <br>                                           
With the increase of computing power and knowledge of AI and Machine Learning we are now getting to a point in the technology where recognition software is becoming very accurate and efficient. This gives us a greater use for the software in different applications, whether it’s for images, text, voice or video.
<br>
                                        <br>
	• Cybersecurity (Anti-Virus, Malware)
    <br>
                                        <br>
Most modern security software packages are employing AI/Machine learning algorithms to help detect, block and remove malware, virus, spyware and intrusions.
<br>
                                        <br>
	• Medical diagnosis (Detection of Cancer)
    <br>
                                        <br>
Machine learning is now being used in the Medical field to help diagnose patients with the help of human Doctors, the AI is about 4% behind an actual person making the diagnosis but with the AI and human doctor working together they have an error rate of 0.5% for cancer detection.[3]
<br>
                                        <br>
	• Digital Assistants (Siri, Alexa, Cortana and Google Assistant)
    <br>
                                        <br>
Using machine learning digital assistants and learn your behaviors and patterns and tailor different services towards you personally. The more time you spend using the digital assistant the more in tune to what you usually request.
<br>
                                        <br>
	• Fraud Detection
    <br>
                                        <br>
Using specific algorithms, machine learning can used to determine the difference between authorized and fraudulent transactions.[4]
<br>
                                    <br>

										<b><big>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?  </big></b>
                                          <br>
                                        <br>
						• Self-Driving cars and Automated Transportation
                          <br>
                                        <br>
With the rise in AI and machine learning we are very close to having fully automated vehicles on our roads.
The rapid increase in machine learning for navigation (Google Maps) and using sensors to avoid objects, this have already resulted in these vehicles performing more safely than a human driver.
This isn’t just for cars, already Boeing 777 pilots spend just seven minutes actually flying, the rest of the work is taken care of by the AI.[5]				<br><br>

										<b><big>What technological or other developments make this possible?</big></b>
                                          <br>
                                        <br>
							
                                   
                                    • Increased adoption of Quantum Computing
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
When Quantum computing is integrated with machine learning we can start to see just how more quickly data can be processed, which will help enhance the ability to analyze and get a better result from the datasets.
<br>
                                    <br>
	• Fine-tuned personalization
    <br>
                                    <br>
Using all the devices that are connected to your daily life, smart watches, phones, and cars. Companies can employ more ways to build relationships with their client base.
<br>
                                    <br>
	• No-code Environments
    <br>
                                    <br>
With infrastructures such as Tensorflow, and Kera we have already seen that open-source platforms exist that are easily assessable to everyone. We will see more people getting into machine learning and using the already available platforms to create their own projects. [6]

      <div class="block"><h1 style=color:black;><big><b>What is the likely impact? </big></b></h1>
        <section>
								<b><big>What is the potential impact of this development?</big></b>
										<br>
										Machine learning in the coming future will impact many business owners, emergency service workers and also the way humans operate. Machine learning will be one of the biggest innovations of the decade. [8]
									
										<br><br>
								<b><big>What is likely to change</big></b>
										<br>
										The most visible changers that we will see to our environment is the leap into self-driving/ automated vehicles. The intention of self-driving cars is that it makes the road safer, deeming that machine learning makes a more reliable decision than a human mind. [9] The change in Health care. Machine learning allows a new direction for mental health care which will allow a more effective predictive model to create affordable, accessible and cheaper healthcare through smartphones, data Science and clinical input.[10]
                                        <br><br>
Additionally, with health care machine learning will affect elder care. According to Washington state university the use of in-home robots is not too far off. These “robots” can reportedly identify when a person has fallen, as well as their daily food/liquid intake. [11]
<br><br>
 The change in emergency services in particularly the police force. Police can use machine learning to provide privacy, pattern recognition and predictive analysis. [12] 					<br><br>
								
										
								<b><big>Which people will be most affected and how?</big></b>
										<br>
										There is not one group of people that will be more affected than another. Everyone will be affected to a degree. It is inevitable that financial markets, retail and customer service, industries with large amount of data and human operators will be augmented or replaced by robots.[13]
										<br><br>
								<b><big>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</big></b>
										<br>
				Artificial intelligence threatens jobs 30% of jobs in Australia. As stated previously individuals who work in industries with large amount of data and human operators are at risk to be made redundant and lose their jobs.
                	<br>
Although the implementation of machine learning is at first negative. The new method is expecting to create over 6 million job opportunities by the end of 2028.[14]

      <div class="block last"><h1 style=color:black;><big><b>How will this affect you? </big></b></h1>
        <section>
								<b><big>How will this affect you daily?</big></b>
										<br>
										Machine learning has many implications both good and bad for me personally. At its current level of development, machine learning is changing the way I view driving as it transitions from a manual process to an automated process which is beneficial as AI’s ability to assess risk improves. I have peace of mind in knowing that my bank account is becoming more secure by the day with “Banks and other businesses in the financial industry using machine learning technology for two key purposes: to identify important insights in data, and prevent fraud.” [15]. With new advancements in machine learning and AI, I am more than likely going to be affected by the changes in the job sector, with jobs being replaced by robots and computers. Machine learning and AI may even surpass human intelligence to a point where they become destructive and misaligned with the morals and goals of humans which may affect my place in society.
										<br><br>
								<b><big>What will be different for you?</b></big>
										<br>
										Mine and everyone else’s daily lives will be changed drastically over the coming years with new developments in AI and machine learning occurring daily. From waking up and brushing my teeth to going to bed at night, it is more than likely that each component in my life will more or less be different with machine learning being used to optimize my household, transportation, job, healthcare and finances. As an example, one day it is likely that machine learning will be able to recognize my individual living pattern to adjust and even create new routines for my daily life. This may be as simple as recognizing when to start brewing my coffee in the morning to analysis of my health and wellbeing through infrared technology, facial recognition and other means.
										<br><br>
								<b><big>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</big></b>
										<br>
My mother has worked for a long time as a community health worker and is now in the field of mediation. One of her only complaints in such a job is the lack of structure and organization regarding the intake and booking of patients. Machine learning will greatly improve how efficiently members of any business including my mother in mediation or my close friend in retail can use their time at work, utilizing personal assistants and AI. For my grandfather machine learning is and will continue to mean a better quality of life, as he is living in an elderly care facility which is an industry that needs a more refined approach that machine learning has the capabilities of achieving. "AI is at a point where it is not far off replacing the need for elderly care workers." [16]
