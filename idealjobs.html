	    <a href="url">https://www.seek.com.au/Job/50418601/?cid=ios-share</a><a href="http://www.os-templates.com/">OS Templates</a>. This template is distributed using a <a href="http://www.os-templates.com/template-terms">Website Template Licence</a>.</p>
		<p>After deciding upon a career in IT I also investigated what jobs there are. I immediately was interested in becoming an Ethical Hacker. An ethical Hackers job is to ensure a business or organisations computer systems are safe. As in the title of the job they are basically hired to hack into the company or organisations network as to identify where any weak areas or issues may lie. This role is known as penetration tester within Australia.<p/>
		<p>My father owns his own accountancy business. One day he was hacked, and the hacker took months and months' worth of data he had been working on for various clients and demanded money in exchange. My father decided not to give in to these demands and as a result lost a lot of work.</p>
		<p>When I read about the Ethical Hacker role, I immediately remembered what had happened and I would love the opportunity to help business/ organisations to be safe from these cyber criminals.</p>
		<p>In order to become an Ethical Hacker you firstly would need a bachelor's degree in IT, cybersecurity or engineering etc. Due to the level of responsibility of this role you would need to gain some relevant experience either in entry level IT roles or network admin etc. After a period of sometime most organisations would offer various programs where you would be able to gain certifications for ethical hacking fields. Once these steps have been completed you would then be able to be considered for a role. Normally companies looking for ethical hackers require 4+ years of experience once again due to the responsibility of the role.</p>
		<p>As previously mentioned, my highest qualification is a Diploma in accountancy, nor do I possess any experience in computing apart from school level. This would not meet the criteria for this role. My Plan is to obtain a bachelor's degree in IT once I have completed this course I plan on obtaining an entry level role which would provide a career path to further my knowledge and enable me to gain whether it be voluntary or paid in programs that lead to certifications in ethical hacking, security analysis, pen testing  and related fields.</p>

      <div class="block"><h1>Matt's Ideal Job. Systems Engineer/Project Engineer</h1>
        <a href="url">https://www.seek.com.au/job/50544467?type=standout#searchRequestToken=3ca1c47b-2525-4ad5-94bb-fb24ef1fefd7</a>
		<p>The ideal role I will be aiming for is the Systems Engineer/Project Engineer. The position allows you to have the most significant input into developing, building, and maintaining a software environment for any business, whether it is a new start-up or an existing multinational corporation. You are given a problem from a client, and you have to come up with a solution that fits the best.</p>
		<p>This role's appeal is that you can be at the ground level of a whole new development or come into an existing environment and put your personal touches on it.</p>
		<h4>Required skills, qualifications, and experience</h4>
		<p>The skills that you need for this role range from technical, logical, and personal.</p>
		<p>You have to understand the software and the environment and how it operates. The technical skills could become very niche, also with new technologies emerging all the time you have to keep your skill set up to date.</p>
		<p>You have to have a systems thinking and critical thinking background which comes into the logical skill. The client will have a complex problem, and you will need to provide them with a simple solution and explain it to them.</p>
		<p>This is where personal skills will come into play. You will need to be able to take all that technical information and translate it so that a non-technical minded person will understand what you are saying.</p>
		<p>Qualifications and certificates on Windows Server, Linux, specific software, will all be needed; having a Bachelors on Information Technology would put you in a more favourable position, having Masters of Systems Engineering would be even better.</p>
		<p>The experience will range from project to project, but having at least 5+ years of doing similar administration type roles would be required for my expectations.</p>
		<h4>Current skills, qualifications, and experience</h4>
		<p>My current skill set is very close to what I have described above; I have an excellent baseline in understanding how small to large environments work and what kind of software should be utilised for the client base.</p>
		<p>The biggest skill I am currently lacking would be the systems and critical thinking area. I have only just begun my research and education into these skills. I can further my education with a Masters of Systems Engineering, which would cover my current lack of skill in this field.</p>
		<p>I believe I have very strong personal skills as I have worked in many customer facing industries which have given me the ability to talk to customers and get points across that may be technical in design. I can turn the technical jargon into something that can be processed by someone who isn't as technical minded.</p>
		<p>My current qualifications range from Windows Server, MS Exchange, SharePoint, Azure Administration, SCCM/SCOM, CISCO, and RedHat/CentOS Linux. Plus, I have a few extra courses such as SPLUNK, ITIL and COMPTIA Security+.</p>
		<p>I've spent the last five years in a Systems Administration role where I have been exposed to a few different software environments where I have performed level 1 to level 3 support. Supporting client bases of a single person up to 500 users.</p>
		<h4>Plan of action</h4>
		<p>My current plan is to get into the Systems Engineer/Project Engineer role will involve learning more about the systems and critical thinking aspect of being a Systems Engineer.</p>
		<p>With my current role, I have access to existing System Engineers, and I will try to work under them from time to time better to understand the day-to-day work of a Systems Engineer.</p>
		<p>I will continue to keep my skills up to date and research new technologies as they emerge.</p>
		<p>I will also work towards my Bachelors of Information Technology.</p>

        <a href="url">https://www.seek.com.au/job/50557514?type=standout#searchRequestToken=fd5bfcbeb7b6-4cc3-af2b-0668e09059c6 /<a> <a href="http://www.os-templates.com/">Free Website Templates</a>. Orciinterdum condimenterdum nullamcorper elit nam curabitur laoreet met praesenean et iaculum.</p>
		<p>The job that I have selected to be my ideal job in the IT industry is as an IT Director for MI World Ltd. MI World is a Multiple Intelligence Education Agency dedicated to helping parents understand their children's specific combinations of intellectual traits to help guide families into an environment where their child will thrive.</p>
		<p>As an IT Director my job would be to oversee most of all operations regarding technology to evaluate and manipulate the operations to address specific goals; establish several different IT systems and policies that would be targeted towards the strategies my management has set out for me; determine the needs of each department of the business regarding technology and in term purchase cost-effective and efficient equipment, also making sure that said equipment is up to date and is being used to full functionality; supervise and coordinate the rest of the IT team; control and report on budget and assist in building new relationships with vendors for IT equipment, software and product.</p>
		<p>At MI World the IT Director's "typical work week may include adding a new component to the webpage, working on the backend of the LMS, tech troubleshooting, supporting an Educator Director in creating an app, etc." </p>
		<p>This job has a lot of appealing qualities for me. The main appeal that this job has for me is the fact that it is a completely remote, work from home position. It also has a huge number  of responsibilities and a broad range of IT skills are needed to able to fulfill those responsibilities, I want my future job to be full of new content and to change daily.</p>
        <h4>Required skills, qualifications, and experience</h4>
		<p>To be considered for this role you first need to have several years' experience in IT coordination or management, working as one of the backbones to all IT related needs within an organization or a singular project in an organization; experience in designing learning courses or curriculum is desired but no crucial; experience in the designing of websites is desired; the ability to train newly hired people in your sector of the business; experience with app building and design software; the ability to analyse a project and make strategic decisions based around it and the ability to multi-take on several diverse projects at the same time in a successful manner.</p>
		<h4>Current skills, qualifications, and experience</h4>
		<p>As you can see this job would have to be a long term goal for me as the requirements to be even considered are nowhere in my ballpark as of yet, but this doesn't mean I could not make a long term plan to meet those requirements.</p>
		<p>To meet these job requirements a plan would look something like this:</p>
		<h4>Plan of action</h4>
		<p>First of all, I need to complete my bachelor's degree, making sure to select specific subjects along the way that would leave me with experience in web design, app design and analysis of a business in order to land a job in the future in IT coordination or management. Ideally, after landing this job I would study some form of learning design and develop my knowledge in the fields specific to the IT Director position at MI World Ltd. Each requirement I end up meeting will help increase my chance of landing this job and so I would need to take every learning opportunity I could along the way.</p>

      <div class="block"><h1>Lachlan's Ideal Job. Junior Data Analyst </h1>
        <a href="url">https://www.seek.com.au/job/50587401?type=standard#searchRequestToken=94fd02e5-7e89-40e2-b061-1eb2a243e366<a>
		<p>This junior data analyst role offered from Atos is a role where you will be trained for 6months, and then be mentored by an IT professional with over 16+ years in the field, whilst being mentored you will learn how to analyse data for the customers you are representing. This role is interesting to me as I want to enter a role similar to this, where you are analysing the businesses you're contracted to, finding ways to improve efficiency, whether they are minute or big-scale changes. I find business analytics interesting in that aspect, being able to make small changes which have rippling effects throughout the whole company, a few changes can flip a company who is struggling into one striving for success once again.</p>
		<h4>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for this position:</h4>
		<p>Atos need an employee who has a background in business analytics/information technology who is able to work in teams as well as an individual efficiently. The employee must also be able to articulate themselves both orally and written, be able to learn new technologies and be proficient in them, as well as be a proven problem solver.</p>
		<h4>A description of my qualifications and experience relevant to this role:</h4>
		<p>Currently I am a way off from being a suitable applicant for this role, I will need to complete further tertiary study in the field to fulfill the requirements Atos desires in a potential candidate. I have had experience working in an environment where deadlines had to be met and problem solving was exercised daily to meet those deadlines, I have also picked up new technology (G-code) quickly and was able to deal with customers and talk them through the process whenever I was designing something for them.</p>
        <h4>How do I plant on obtaining the skills, qualifications and experience required for this position:</h4>
		<p>Mainly I need to finish my tertiary learning, after which I will try to get a job in a similar field to get some more work experience, whether that be as an IT consultant to gain more customer service experience, or maybe as a data analyst in a smaller company part time or at a lower level.</p>
