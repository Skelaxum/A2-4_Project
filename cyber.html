								<b><big>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</big></b>
										<br>
										As cyber-attacks are a very common occurrence. Data has gone from being stored in a singular system to being transferred between multiple systems at the same time, and this constantly creates new issues to solve for cyber security experts.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>There are two sides to the state of the art of cyber security, cyber-attacks and cyber security:</b>
										<br>
										Cyber attackers are currently employing several newly emerging tactics in order to bypass and access secure, encrypted data. "Man in the middle attacks (MiM)" can bypass firewalls, and any other tool-based security typically by gaining access to a poorly secured Wi-Fi router or internet access point. Once accessed the attacker will attempt to use his knowledge and tools to intercept, decrypt and read your data and can even go as far as retrieving a user's login credentials for a bank or email account. Cyber attackers are also utilizing other companies' technology to their advantage. Attackers can use Google Glass and other spying software to track fingerprint movements on different devices such as an ATM or a phone screen in order to use that information later. By 2015 alone there were more than 65 million smart devices installed across homes and business in the US, with each new piece of technology being installed contributing to the risk factor of said business or home.
										<br><br>
										Cyber security professionals are constantly creating new measures in order to counter to progression of cyber attackers. Virtual Dispersive Networking (VDN) from companies such as Dispersive Technologies, handle MiM attacks by splitting essentially splitting the data into different paths such as the cloud or a data center, encrypting that data to counteract the invasive strategy of a MiM attack. Business can install Smart-grid technology in order to protect their many smart devices that are currently installed and will be installed in the future

									<b><big>What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</big></b>
										<br>
										Currently the best way to handle the ever-evolving strategies of cyber attackers is for cyber security professionals to constantly learn and adapt to new technologies such as VDN or Smart-grid technology. As an everyday user of computers, all humans can try their best to practice safe and ethical use of the internet and all technologies surrounding it. Business should invest a percentage of their budget into cyber security just as they would into physical security as it is becoming the main means of a business' data or money being accessed. Business' should also upkeep their IT infrastructure with routine check-ins on servers, data centres and internet access points.
										<br><br>
										Cyber security seemingly has endless possibilities, with new cyber-attacks being planned by the day and new measures to protect against those attacks being implanted by the day. Theoretically we can come up with some amazing concepts on paper and in our heads in order to counter cyber-attacks such as AI systems that can instantly detect and neutralize an attack, or forcefield type data protectors that surround an enterprise. Edward Snowden, infamous NSA whistle-blower claims that the NSA have had such ideas in development. Snowden says, "the agency is developing a cyber defence system that would instantly and autonomously neutralize foreign cyberattacks against the US and could be used to launch retaliatory strikes as well." This program is called "Monster Mind".

										<b><big>What technological or other developments make this possible?</big></b>
										<br>
									<b>The technology that currently makes Cyber security possible is the likes of: </b>
										<br>
										- Cameras (Infrared, Night-vision, etc)
										<br>
										- Tool-based security (Anti-Malware, Spam detectors, etc)
										<br>
										- Programming and programmers dedicated to cyber security
										<br><br>
									<b>The technology that is being implemented into cyber security measures now are:</b>
										<br>
										- AI and Machine Learning (Monster Mind, etc
										<br>
										- Cloud based security measures (Security Assertion Markup Language, etc
										<br>
										- NetAPT (Software for mapping control system pathways)

      <div class="block"><h1 style=color:black;><big><b>What is the likely impact? </big></b></h1>
        <section>
								<b><big>What is the potential impact of this development?</big></b>
										<br>
										The world is more technologically reliant than ever before. The impact on the advancement in technology is undeniable and advancing at faster rate than anyone could have anticipated. 
										<br><br>
										Cyber Attacks are estimated to occur 2244 times per day as of this current year 2020.Cyber security acts as the only measure to prevent online fraud and helps in risk management. This has tremendous impacts on society such as anxiety, loss of confidence in technology, financial loss, stress, loss of reputation for a business, massive fines can occur if business get caught out. 
										<br><br>
								<b><big>What is likely to change</big></b>
										<br>
										Already more and more companies are switching to virtual desktops. COVID 19 has also had an impact as this year has seen a massive boom in remote workers operating outside of the safety of a corporate network. 
										<br><br>
										Currently what is mostly used by business is two-factor authentication. Now with more workers working from home with this expecting to continue as a new way of live. The employees of organisations are now being targeted to gain access. We have already seen a rise in biometric authentication, and this is expected to rise. Biometric authentication is fingerprint. Thumbprint retina, iris, voice, or other facial recognition technology.
										<br><br>
								<b><big>Which people will be most affected and how?</big></b>
										<br>
										I think businesses will most effected and those in the company's cyber security roles. Cyber security is a massive topic to cover as there are many, many various technologies that go into it. Machine learning and artificial intelligence has made companies cyber security more effective and successful. However, with machine learning and artificial intelligence breaking into computers and systems has also become so easy. Companies in the past has spent a lot of effort, resources and money figuring out their organisations network topography. With the use of AI expediting this process by observing and learning network traffic patterns and recommending security policies this elevates a lot of the above and allows a company to use its people in more productive areas.
										<br><br>
								<b><big>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</big></b>
										<br>
										Now that cybercrime have begun using AI as part of their attack strategies, it's become imperative that businesses and individuals stay one step ahead. human analysts will no longer be able to fend off on their own against the extremely sophisticated attacks.
										<br>
										The Printing and publishing industry already have seen a massive declined and in the next 10 years expected to be non-existent. 
										<br>
										Cashiers at supermarkets, banks etc. We have once again seen a massive decrease in this type of work with the likes of self-serve checkouts. And once again due to COVID 19 changing the world as we know it has also speed things up due to not wanting human contact due to the risk of contracting the virus.

      <div class="block last"><h1 style=color:black;><big><b>How will this affect you? </big></b></h1>
        <section>
								<b><big>How will this affect you daily?</big></b>
										<br>
										Artificial intelligence makes our lives more efficient. AI powers many programs and services that help us do everyday things like connecting with friends, using an email program or even taking a uber like ride share service. 
										<br><br>
								<b><big>What will be different for you?</b></big>
										<br>
										Last year I had $1000 transferred to account without my authority. I did not know the receiver nor authorize this amount. The bank or the police were not able to do anything. Because of experiencing being hacked myself. I looked at all the situations that could improve my security. I often used the same passwords for multiple accounts. The passwords I did have where somewhat basic as I never had taken cybercrime seriously, now I also do not look on untrustworthy websites. I updated my phone, so I must unlock it with my face or passcode, and I also updated my laptop to start requiring my fingerprint on start-up. 
										<br><br>
								<b><big>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</big></b>
										<br>
										One of my friends started his own painting company about 1-2 years ago. He not only works with a lot of private customers but also with other companies enlisting his services. He completed work for one company and sent them an invoice. He began chasing the company for payment only to be told he had already been paid. He checked bank through his bank statements and could not find payment. The business provided proof that the payment had been made. What had happened was a hacker changed the bank details on the top the invoice sent by my friend and the company paid into the incorrect account by no fault of their own. 6 months later my friend has not been able to get back what he is owed. He has now implemented a third-party cyber security company to prevent any data breaches again.
