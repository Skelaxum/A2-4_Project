      ‘MediPlanner’ is a medical app used by both patients and medical practitioners. ‘MediPlanner’ has three main goals: Linking medical practitioners to hospitals; Linking patients to medical practitioners; and helping with early detection of mental health issues in adolescents. Currently there are thousands of health apps available, with such functions as:
      <br><br>
      •	Setting reminders for medication
      <br><br>
      •	Recording body measurements
      <br><br>
      •	Booking attending doctors’ appointments
      <br><br>
      •	Step tracking
      <br><br>
      •	Sleep tracking
      <br><br>
      •	Calorie counting

      <br><br>

      ‘TheTechTops’ wanted to design a health app different to those currently offered, revolutionising the medical sector, and streamlining medical services for both patient and practitioner.

      </div>

      <div class="block"><h1 style=color:red;><big><b>Sign-Up/Login </big></b></h1>
      <section>
      <br>
      •	Users, both patients and practitioners, will need to sign-up to ‘MediPlanner’ via the apps login/signup page and then login using those details to receive a unique QR code. This QR code is used for containing multiple data-points of both patient and practitioner.
      <br><br>

      •	Patients will sign-up by using their personal email (e.g. JohnSmith@gmail.com), setting a password, and entering a range of details from age and height to current medical problems and prescriptions.
      <br><br>

      •	Practitioners will sign-up by using a business email (e.g. JohnSmith@ths.tas.gov.au), and entering a range of details from current practice to resumes and references.
      <br><br>

      •	The sign-up page will implement an opt-in button for the mental health services included within ‘MediPlanner’. This will also be able to be turned on or off in the settings regardless of opting in.

      </section>
      </div>



      <div class="last block"><h1 style=color:red;><big><b>Patients Tab </big></b></h1>
      <section>
      <br>
      The patients tab has one main purpose, achieved with multiple features: patient data management. Medical history, prescriptions, appointments, and all other relevant information for medical practitioners will be entered here for future use.
      <br><br>
      <h3 style=color:green;><big><b>Patient Data Management </big></b></h3>
      <br><br>
      <style=color:black;><b><big>Concept:</big></b>
      <br><br>
      These features key purpose is to allow for the universal exchange of patient details among certified doctors, hospital staff and other medical professionals across the public and private sectors. These details will be able to be altered over time to account for new medical history, prescriptions, appointments, and other relevant information for medical practitioners. No longer will doctors need elaborate interfaces on old and slow computers to read and log information about a patient. No longer will a patient be reliable for remembering names of medications, date and times of appointments. No longer will receptionists need to constantly take calls and log appointments all day. No longer will it be important to book the same doctors, let alone the same practice every time you need to see a practitioner. ‘MediPlanner’ would revolutionise ease of access all around to medical practitioners and patients and increase the overall efficiency of the medical sector.
      <br><br>
      <b><big>Features:</big></b>
      <br><br>
      •	Once an account is formed a patient will be prompted to enter their current medical details. These details will include prescriptions, current and past health issues, immunisation records, surgery records, x-rays and all other relevant medical history.
      <br><br>
      •	This information will be accessible via a patients QR code.
      <br><br>

      •	Patients using the application will have the ability to book appointments, cancel appointments, see future and previous appointments, and a list of all available appointments.

      <br><br>

      <b><big>Usability: </big></b>
      <br><br>
      •	Patients will enter the relevant sections of the patient’s tab and enter information such as current ailments or prescriptions.

      •	Upon arrival to an appointment a patient displays their unique QR code to the medical practitioner, who can then scan that code from within the app the log the patient’s information

      •	All patients will have the option to retract information from a practice in order to protect privacy and give the patient piece of mind.

      </div>

      <div class="block"><h1 style=color:red;><big><b>Practitioners Tab </big></b></h1>
      <section>
      <br>
      The practitioners tab has three main features: Linking doctors to hospitals, retrieving appointment information, and sending out prescription information. All features will be accessible through the practitioners’ tab of ‘MediPlanner’. This tab of ‘MediPlanner’ will also include a QR code scanner for access to practitioner’s data.
      <br><br>
      <h3 style=color:green;><big><b>Linking Doctors to Hospitals </big></b></h3>
      <br><br>
      <b><big>Concept:</big></b>
      <br><br>
      Currently Hospitals are spending millions every year on agency fees. The service the agency provides is when a hospital requires a doctor or nurse, they send a mailshot out to various agencies. The various agencies then send a mailshot out to their data base and doctors will respond with their availability. Due to hospitals working with nearly 100 different agencies they can potentially then be wrapped up responding to the various queries from all the different agencies. Also, for the doctor who is signed with various agencies he/she will be receiving the same alert many times depending on how many agencies they are signed up to. The other issue is many consultants earn a low wage and relay heavily on commission, this can make a consultant desperate to get a placement. If they have a doctor who is available however a hospital has not asked, they will forward a doctor’s details onto as many hospitals as possible even a hospital has not asked for a doctor or not. Doctors may receive multiple calls throughout the day from various agencies and many times they get so sick of it they asked to be completely removed from data bases. The idea of the app is the doctor can log their availability and chose which hospitals they would be visible too.
      <br><br>
      <b><big>Features:</big></b>
      <br><br>
      •	‘MediPlanner’ would contain information on each hospital including: ONCALL requirements; junior support; and daily/ hourly rate so potential medical practitioners would know exactly what the job will entail.

      •	Hospitals would be able to contact doctors who are available to work and engage with them on a locum basis.

      •	Medical practitioners will be alerted of new vacancies and be able to select which hospitals they are and are not visible to.

      •	Medical practitioners will be able to log their availability in order for hospitals to review.

      <br><br>

      <b><big>Usability: </big></b>
      <br><br>
      •	Doctors and medical staff will upload references, credentials, and all relevant information into the Doctor tab of ‘MediPlanner’

      •	For doctors to be able to work in hospitals they must have certain paperwork. Rather than the doctor having to complete this paperwork for each agency they can complete said paperwork and upload to the app. This information will then be stored and available to potential hospitals.

      •	All of this information will be stored within the app and accessible by scanning the medical practitioners unique QR code.


      <br><br>

      <h3 style=color:green;><big><b>Retrieving appointment information </big></b></h3>
      <br><br>
      <b><big>Concept:</big></b>
      <br><br>
      Currently medical practitioners are faced with several means to retrieve appointment information, from phone calls and emails to an array of applications and websites. ‘MediPlanner’ aims to eliminate the vast amount of information medical practitioners must receive through separate means and consolidate it into one easy to read tab of an app. <br><br>
      <b><big>Features:</big></b>
      <br><br>

      •	Within the practitioner tab of ‘MediPlanner’, potential appointments will be accessible by medical practitioners. These appointments will be able to be investigated further within a detail tab or accepted/denied depending on the specific medical practitioners’ schedule.

      •	These appointment notifications will display basic information such as name, date of birth, a generalised description of symptoms and any potential health risks. This feature could also benefit the population during a public health crisis such as COVID-19 as it would automatically alert practitioners of certain symptoms to look out for such as cold symptoms.

      •	Each patient that a practitioner accepts is logged within the app for future reference of said practitioner.

      <br><br>

      <b><big>Usability: </big></b>
      <br><br>
      •	Doctors and medical staff will upload references, credentials, and all relevant information into the Doctor tab of ‘MediPlanner’

      •	For doctors to be able to work in hospitals they must have certain paperwork. Rather than the doctor having to complete this paperwork for each agency they can complete said paperwork and upload to the app. This information will then be stored and available to potential hospitals.

      •	All of this information will be stored within the app and accessible by scanning the medical practitioners unique QR code.

      <div class="block"><h1 style=color:red;><big><b>Mental Health Features </big></b></h1>
      <section>
      <br><br>
      <b><big>Concept:</big></b>
      <br><br>
      The idea of the application is for parents to be alerted if their child has any mental health issues, they should be made aware of. Adolescent suicide is now at the highest rate it has ever been. Mental health issues in the youth of the world is rising at an incredible rate. Parents are often completely unaware their child is unhappy or struggling and are in complete shock when the child is diagnosed or something more irreversible/severe happens.  Many children do not want to tell anyone if they are struggling, they may not know how to communicate this, they may fear not being taken seriously or laughed at. Often children whose parents who are also struggling keep things to themselves as the feel as though they do not want to burden their parents. There have also been some cases where another child has been peer pressured into committing self-harm or worse suicide. This app would enable parents to step in sooner and pick up on various unfavourable circumstances or behaviours that may have been overlooked previously.
        br><br>
      <b><big>Features:</big></b>
      <br><br>
      •	‘MediPlanners’ mental health features will be targeted at young adolescents aged between (13 – 17). The app will monitor the adolescent’s phone if the child uses certain key words that are concerning. E.g. kill myself, cutting, suicide, overdose etc or visits concerning websites.

      •	This feature will work by having two or more apps communicate. (e.g. parents to children, mental health practitioner to patient). The feature will be accessible from all tabs of ‘MediPlanner’ depending on how the user will use it (e.g. parent vs child).

      •	New key words can be entered by parents, allowing for custom alerts.

      •	The parent will be notified via an alert on the app with details of the concerning content. This will then allow the parent to intervene with the child’s mental health.

      •	All concerning content will be logged for future reference.

      <br><br>

      <b><big>Usability: </big></b>
      <br><br>
      •	‘MediPlanners’ mental health features will be an opt-in at sign-up service. These settings will also always remain toggleable from within ‘MediPlanner’.

      •	In order for this feature to work both a “parent” and “child” need to sign-up and link ‘Medi-planner’ apps via the QR code scanner. (In this case “parent” and “child” refer to any two parties who have agreed to utilise these features.)

      •	The “parent” features will be accessible via the practitioner page whereas the “child” features will be accessible via the patient page.
      <br><br>


      </section>
      </div>

      <div class="block last"><h1 style=color:red;><big><b>Privacy & Security </big></b></h1>
      <section>
      <br><br>
      <b><big>Login/Log-out:</big></b>
      <br><br>
      •	 First of all, 'MediPlanner' will require a secure login page, which is the first thing all users will see within the app. Once a user has entered the app there are many things, we can implement into the login to keep their account secure.

      •	Users will be required to enter a unique Username, Email, and password.
      •	Users will also be required to enter a re-captcha code upon each individual login.

      •	Other potential processes that could be implemented to a secure login for 'MediPlanner' are two factor authentications, and an email confirmation service.
        br><br>
      <b><big>Certificates:</big></b>
      <br><br>
      The next important measure to consider is private vs public security certificates. A security certificate is an encryption tool used in securing and encrypting data that is travelling between the server and client. A public certificate is distributed by a public CA (Certificate authority) whereas a private certificate is distributed from within a local CA. When creating an application both categories of certificates must be weighed up in order to find the optimal option. Public certificates (Public CA) can help save time, money, and resources because many of the already published applications configuration can recognize a large amount of public CA’s. Private certificates (Local CA) are utilised in circumstances with a more limited number of users. They allow you to select who and where certificates are issued and therefore who can access your resources, which helps to provide better security. The downside to a Local CA is the potential time, resources, and money that must be invested in order to upkeep such an operation. “No matter which CA you use to issue your certificates, the system administrator controls which CAs will be trusted by applications on his system.” (IBM, 2020).

      <br><br>

      <b><big>Database Security: </big></b>
      <br><br>
      Database security can be defined as “a range of security controls designed to protect the Database Management System (DBMS).” (Looker Data Sciences, 2020). To make ‘MediPlanners’ data safe our team we need to implement measures such as: system hardening and monitoring to increase security and monitor for threats; authentication of logins; backups to copy and store data on a separate system; encryption to hide information from unknown readers; and the use of a VPN (virtual private network) to allow for secure access to internal networks and data systems. <br><br>
