								<b><big> Matthew Plazina 
                                </big></b>
										<br> 
										The interview was conducted with Matthew Plazina (Matt). Matt is one of our group members for Introduction to IT. Jarrah and Lachlan were extremely excited to sit down with Matt virtually to gather a better understanding of life in the IT work force.
										<br>
		  <b><big> Introduction 
			    </big></b>
			  <br> Hey Matt,
Thank you for joining us this evening. As you are aware, we are conducting this interview today for our university subject “Introduction to IT.” This assignment requires a production of a report outlining various aspects of the IT industry. Furthermore, commencing development on a It project. 
Every team member In our group has researched and identified where in the work force they would like to pursue a career. Although research can only tell you so much. 
Matt as the IT professional the purpose of this interview is to gather a real life understanding of what it is actually like working in the industry. 	<br> <br>

		  
										
										<b>Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</b>
										<br>
										
  
Matt works as an IT system technician for the Australian Defence Force, his day to day job revolves mainly around system administration and networking. Some examples of work Matt has to do on a daily basis may include;server maintenance, user creation, enforcing policies, general server administration, and education for users. 

<br>
<br>
	<b>Please tell us about the industry you work in.</b>		
<br>
As we know the IT industry is forever changing. When Matthew first commenced his job at the Defence Force in 2014 the application used were Windows server 2003 and windows XP. Although Windows server and XP worked and accommodated for the needs of the defense force windows unfortunately cut support to the applications. This required the defense force to implement to change and adapt to new software. His team now uses window server 2016 with a hope to transition to windows server 2019 in the next 12 months.
 Matthew explained changing software was a challenging but great eye-opening process. In IT it is important to use a software that is in a range where it is well supported by whoever is producing it.
 
<br>
<br>
	<b>What other kinds of work do you have to do?</b>	
    
<br>
Matt has many tasks which may be assigned to him, currently at the time of the interview, Matt has been setting up a whole new system and setup at work. This has required Matt to get all the equipment in, making sure all the parts and equipment is there, breaking them down into locations of where they will go and delegate to others, who will install the hardware/software. Matt also has to set up backups in regards to where and when data will be backed up, he will set these up incrementally to back up daily, weekly, and monthly. Once set up, the main focus is maintenance, making sure there's enough space for hosts, the updates are coming through and that users are abiding by the policies set in place. If something does go wrong, Matt needs to fix it to a certain standard before you can push it out to be accessed by the users.

									<b>Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about
them.</big></b>
										<br>
		(Please note the name Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 have been added by the writer to help differentiate each area of the work force. Matt did not give these descriptions)
        <br><br> Matt's work is known to be the general admin IT area (level 1). The people that Matt work with all have different strengths that they excel in. These different areas include
- exchange 
<br><br>
-  Admin 
<br><br>
-  Skype for business
<br><br>
- Policy 
<br><br>
His colleagues that are a level above him specify in aside administrator (level 2). This work can include taking care of a sight in a specific area and reporting incidents and change of requests to their superiors (level 3).
Above level 2 is level 3. Members of level 3 are individuals who look after a much bigger area such as a state. Level 3 take care of how a policy will work and how it is implemented. This policy is then given to level 2 then to level 1.
<br>
<br>
	<b>Who are some IT professionals you have contact with, and what sort of interactions do you have with them?</b>		
<br>
Being in the Australian Defence Force, security is paramount, but sometimes Matt will be in contact with IT professionals who are contracted from a corporate setting, both having different experiences, and ways of doing things, as well as standards they hold higher than others. For example, Matt is mainly security focused being in the defence force, but the contractors which are hired are trying to get the job done in the most efficient manor, where security is not held to the same regards as Matt. Some companies Matt has worked with include, Del and Cisco.
<br>
<br>
	<b> What about your interactions with clients or investors?</b>			
<br>Matt’s general clients are the staff air force, army or navy. The clients Matt work with haven’t necessarily got the highest expertise with IT. These clients know the basics, logging on and don’t their daily tasks. Matt explains the importance of knowing your expertise but being able to communicate with those who know nothing about IT. It is very important to speak in simplified terminology so that all clients can understand.
 <br>
<br>
	<b> What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</b>
    <br> Matt spends a lot of his time setting up and configuring SharePoint environments, which requires setting up a new page with correct permissions for each type of user, be able to limit who can contribute what to where, as well as make the whole experience as intuitive as possible. Matt also spends a lot of his time on server maintenance, which requires the server to be running properly, making sure the servers aren't full, the software when patched is done correctly, making sure any hardware issues such as faulty peripherals are replaced under warranty if possible.'
<br>
<br>

<b> Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</b>
<br> Although Matt is very good at his job, like any job it has its challenges. The difficulty Matt identified through the interview was the restriction he and his team felt when proposing a 
new idea to their superiors. Regardless if Matts team had formulated a good new idea in regard to productivity, user access and security. When submitting this idea to superiors the challenge can often be hinderance. The bosses frequently not specialising in the IT field. Furthermore this process can take an extremely long time. Adding to Matt’s frustration. 
<br>
<br>
<b> Matt, you just touched on how you said you were using XP and you were paying for customer support from a third party. Is there a reason why you stuck with XP even though it was not being supported by Microsoft?</b>
<br> Changing from Windows Xp to a newer operating system is a big task which has a lot of slow moving parts which need to be accounted for, and being in the Defence Force, it was not feasible to swap on a whim because of the time frame needed. They would need to figure out what system, with what programs on what platform, would they want to swap to one server for everything, or have many smaller servers, as well as getting the vendors for the programs onboard with the job at hand.
<br>
<br>
<b> 
With Windows 10 now, has there been much difference between going from XP to windows 10 in limitations?</b>
<br> The limitations of XP have been a problem when swapping from windows XP to windows 10 which Matt currently uses, the programs developed on XP sometimes cant be recoded as it just isn't possible or feasible to do so, and sometimes it was just not possible at all. Programs would require either new coding, or a new program. Running virtual Windows XP was considered, but the security of that would not have been an ideal situation. <br>

<br>
<br>
<b> Can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of
the IT industry?   </b>

<br> IT industry interact with each other, and IT professionals can talk to another IT professional, even if they work in a niche environment, as people are constantly in contact with each other now and learning from each other.<br> 

<br>
<br>
<b> Lastly, everyone has a base knowledge in IT, is that a change from back in the day where people had a specialisation and were not in contact with other departments, compared to today where we are in constant contact?
</b>	
<br> Companies are always downsizing and trying to get the most out of their employees, so people need to have a base to be able to do a plethora of tasks because not all staff are on at the same time. Constantly learning via google, or being in contact with other professionals outside your expertise area is common, and its a good way to attain a wide range of IT knowledge <br>
