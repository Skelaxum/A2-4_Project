	  <h2>What does it do? </h2>
        <p>Clouds, Services and Servers are used within the corporate world to provide a user base with the tools that they require to get their work completed. This is usually the backbone of the corporation to achieve the needs of the company. <a href="http://www.os-templates.com/">OS Templates</a>.

		<p>If you think of most environments on the interest, websites, collaboration sites and anything else it would be using some form of cloud or physical server environment.</p>
		<p>With the introduction of cloud computing the cost of running a business can be reduced and small startups now have the opportunity to start with less overheads.</p> 
      </div>
      <div class="block"><h1>What is the state of the art of this new technology? </h1>
	  <h2>Microsoft Azure </h2>
        <p>Microsoft Azure is leading the cloud server enterprise. The easy to use interface, cost analysis and flexibility of this service makes it the major provider for a multi-domain level environment to a single standalone environment.</p>
		<h2>Amazon Web Services</h2>
		<p>Amazon over the years have increased their presence in the cloud market with products such as AMS (Marketing Services) and AWS (Web Services).</p>   
      </div>
      <div class="block last"><h1>What can be done now?</h1>
	  
	  <h2>Setting up office environments (IaaS)</h2> 
        <p>With the advancements in cloud technology, Internet capability and faster processing power from hardware an office that would normally run on physical servers on premise can now be 100% hosted in a cloud environment.</p> <a href="http://www.os-templates.com/">Free Website Templates</a>. Orciinterdum condimenterdum nullamcorper elit nam curabitur laoreet met praesenean et iaculum.</p>
		
		<h2>Creating portals for users to collaborate (PaaS)</h2>
		<p>A big area in which cloud services is utilized is in the collaboration area, this have created a better working environment where you can have multiple users accessing and working on one task simultaneously.</p>
		
		<h2>Hosting storage for users</h2>
		<p>Over the years storage in a cloud environment has gone from being something many users never experience to being a prominent feature for new applications and services. Giving users access to extra data storage that they can use in anyone they like</p> 
      </div>
      
      <div class="block"><h1>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? </h1>
        <p>We will see SaaS (Software as a service) being developed closely alongside of AI/Machine learning. This will be able to create a service that can be flexible, reliable, resilient and future proofed.</p>
		
		<h2>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="block"><h1>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h1>
        <p>The development of faster computing power, access to faster and more stable internet has seen the rise of cloud services and servers. The ease of use and access by users has concreted this into a part of everyday life.</p>
		<p>Nearly every type of IT solution we are using today has some sort of cloud environment or access.<p>  
      </div>
      <div class="block last"><h1>What is the likely impact?</h1>
        <p>With the increase of easy to access cloud-based services we will see more and more user-friendly environments that will be able to be accessed more often. Such as Google Docs, and MS Teams these services have already made a massive impact on how we all work together.</p>
		
		<h2>What is the potential impact of this development?</h2>
		<p>The overall decline in physical infrastructure for office environments. The move towards cloud environments will bring the need to only have a way of accessing your enterprise such as BYOD or virtual sessions from a very basic computer.</p>
		
		<h2>What is likely to change?</h2>
		<p>How we think about hosting services, setting up a new work environment, playing a video game or even hosting a meeting. All these things will be moved in one way or another to a cloud platform. The initial start is there and with the current climate of the world, moving towards a remote platform will be key for certain businesses to survive.</p>
		
		<h2>Which people will be most affected and how?</h2>
		<p>The increase in cloud services will be a technology that will affect everyone in every way of life. It is already utilized for so many things that most people don't even realize they use it for.</p>
		
		<h2>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h2>
		<p>Within the administration of these environments we will see a reduction in onsite personal being replaced with remote offices and administrators who can fix incidents remotely.</p>
		<p>There will be a reduction in a workforce if AI and Machine learning starts to get incorporated into working environments.</p>
