Mediplaner as an application will be created with intent to be used on iOS compatible devices initially, this will be achieved through using the intuitive programming language for macOS called "Swift". Swift is a language with high safety integrity, but also is able to run programs at fast speeds, which is necessary for applications intended to be used primarily on hand held devices. The application will be a Product as a service (PaaS) which means that the application will host and transfer data via a cloud, which the company will most likely outsource to third party providers to save on costs, appose to hosting their own centre inhouse. Ideally the application would also have a QR code generator built into the application, to achieve this, the  company could use websites such as ‘Nayuki’s QR code generator’ (https://github.com/nayuki/QR-Code-generator) to help users create their own QR code, which would be saved in the application once registered, by scanning this QR code, it will quickly bring up all relevant information a medical professional or anyone else would need. Security for an application with such sensitive and confidential information is paramount, a security development team would be with us from day one, so there will hopefully be a minimised risk for a security breach. By testing software inhouse multiple times, trying to find ways to breach the integrity of the application, we will also minimise any risk of being compromised. We would also recommend that users disconnect from Wi-Fi and use mobile data if possible, in hopes to minimise hackers who are able to retrieve information from peoples phones over Wi-Fi, which has been a problem for many application developers in the past.

  The biggest skill shorted we have within the group for this project is the knowledge base of application development in general. There would be a lot of research into MIT App developer as a starting point, and Apple IOS application development. Going into this project will be a complete learning environment with a lot of testing and adjusting with what we need to achieve.
  <br>
  Design skills would be required, the development of the application is just one part. The application environment needs to be user friendly and robust. Having an understanding of basic design principles will help this along.
  <br>
  Security skills with creating a secure platform that the user feels comfortable uploading potentially sensitive information. This skill would come in the form of learning about public and private certificates, understanding VPNs and further research into Cybersecurity.
  <br>
  Database skills, the backend of the application would have a lot of data that needs to be processed and organised. Being able to design, implement and manage a database for this environment is a key part if making the application into a functioning system.
